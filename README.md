# Introduction

This repository was created as a student project for [HBEH 720](http://racialequity.web.unc.edu/) (Leading for Health Equity) at the [Gillings School of Global Public Health](https://sph.unc.edu/), part of the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/).

The Northside neighborhood is an historically Black neighborhood in Chapel Hill, NC
that has gone through "studentization" (i.e. gentrification by students who are
primarily not Black). A history of this neighborhood, as well as stories told by
historical residents can be found at [The Marian Cheek Jackson Center website](https://jacksoncenter.info/northside-stories/the-history-of-northside/).
